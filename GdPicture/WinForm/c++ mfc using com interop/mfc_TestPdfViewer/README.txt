The classes starting with C (such as CGdPicturePDF.h) are generated through the MFC Class Wizard from Microsoft Visual Studio 2017. This wizard is no longer available in Visual Studio 2019. They are generated by selecting the class from the TLB file and choosing "Add MFC Class from TypeLib"

The GdViewer0.h and GdViewer0.cpp are generated differently as they are ActiveX components and are generated by doing : "Add MFC Class From ActiveX Control" and select it from the registry (the gdviewer dll must be registered for this to work) and then select GdPicture14.GdViewer in the combox box.
